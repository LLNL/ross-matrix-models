# Matrix Models

This repository contains 2 models for testing the LLNL-modified version of ROSS.
They demonstrate the use of the time class, LP interface, and event cancellation.

## Models

matrix:

 A model used for debugging.
 It is kind of like PHOLD, but also enables proving that messages were received in order, using a finite ring matrix algebra.

matrix-cancel:

  A model used for debugging and illustration of event cancellation (retraction).
  Also exercises commit function.

## Building the code:

1. Build the LLNL-modified ROSS:

    cd ross/src
    # Edit Makefile to set copmiler name (one of the first lines)
    # currectly the compiler is mpicxx (MPI C++ compiler necessary).
    # Make and copy library to ../lib directory:
    make
    make install
    cd ../..

2. Build matrix model:

    cd matrix
    # Set compiler also in compile.matrix-model
    # Build:
    . compile.matrix-model
    cd ..

3. Run test:

    cd matrix
    # Test run script usus mpirun to launch a parallel job.
    # this is a small test and runs as is on many login nodes,
    # workstations, and laptops. For other machines, getting
    # a node allocation might be required first, and perhaps
    # replacing mpirun with e.g. srun.
    ./run.matrix-model

    # The output of the test run can be compared for correctness
    # with sample output at the end of the run.matrix-model file.
    # See that file for more details.
    cd ..

4. Build matrix-cancel model:

    cd matrix-cancel
    . compile.matrix-cancel
    cd ..

5. Run matrix-cancel test:

    cd matrix-cancel
    ./runloop.sh

   Test takes maybe a couple of minutes. Lots of text data is eventually
   dumped to the screen. This data is also saved in files with names
   run.out.x.y where x is number of nodes (1 in runloop.sh at this time),
   and y is number of MPI tasks per node.

   At the end of the test, the name of each run.out.* file is printed
   in between #'s. After each name is printed is a diff of relevant
   data betwen this output file and a sequential run. If the runs
   (code) are correct, there should be no output from diff, and just
   the file names are listed.


6. Enjoy :-)
